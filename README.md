# Conscientous Objector
A personal utility designed to reinforce constructive routines. 

I have an individual problem of not being able to execute on the constructive behaviors that swirl around in my head. This app will be a constant check-in companion that will allow me to stay organized. The commitment I will need to create this app is a part of the design, a way for me to cement this new point of interest into my routine.  

Others can log in, to see what I've got going on, but they can't edit anything significant without my key. They can use their own profiles to access. 

You can preload the app's reminder messages. 
This app will pull motivational phrases from history's thinkers via a philosophy api
